**Identifying Ticks and Public Health Significance**

Key external features of hard ticks (family *Ixodidae*) are visible with a hand lens or low-power microscope. These ticks possess a rigid dorsal shield (scutum), which partially covers the back in females and the entire dorsum in males. Their mouthparts (capitulum) project forward from the front of the body, and both nymphs and adults have eight legs but lack antennae. Additional traits include the position of the anal groove, presence of spiracular plates, and visibility of eyes or festoons. These can help distinguish among genera. These structural markers are useful for identifying common North American species, including *Ixodes scapularis* (black-legged tick), Dermacentor variabilis (American dog tick), and *Amblyomma americanum* (lone star tick) (Keirans & Litwak, 1989).

Ticks in the United States can transmit a range of pathogens These include bacteria, viruses, and parasites. These can lead to serious illnesses in humans. Among the most prevalent tickborne diseases are Lyme disease, anaplasmosis, ehrlichiosis, babesiosis, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and Powassan virus disease (CDC, 2024a). Each year, U.S. health departments report more than 46,000 cases of these infections (CDC, 2024b). As tick populations expand, the risk of exposure increases—even in regions where certain species were previously uncommon (CDC, 2024c). To reduce the chance of infection, the CDC advises using EPA-registered insect repellents, wearing protective clothing such as long sleeves and pants, performing thorough tick checks after outdoor activities, and removing any attached ticks promptly and properly (CDC, 2024d).

# **Midterm Corrections**

Dear Dr. Belsare,

Thank you for the opportunity to submit corrections. I reviewed all questions where partial credit was deducted and made appropriate revisions. For your reference, I’ve included my corrected responses to Questions 7 and 9 below.

**Question 7**

In May 2015, a catastrophic die-off of Saiga antelope occurred in central Kazakhstan, resulting in the deaths of more than 200,000 individuals in less than two weeks. This event remains one of the most severe wildlife mortality incidents ever recorded. Understanding the proximate cause, environmental triggers, and ecological mechanisms provides valuable insight into wildlife disease ecology and future conservation planning. (20 points)

**Proximate Cause**

The immediate cause of death was hemorrhagic septicemia, triggered by the normally benign bacterium *Pasteurella multocida* type B. Under ordinary conditions, this bacterium exists harmlessly in the tonsils and upper respiratory tract of Saiga. During the 2015 calving season, unusually warm and humid weather created ideal conditions for bacterial proliferation and virulence activation. Once systemic infection occurred, the bacteria spread rapidly through the bloodstream, causing acute septicemia and internal hemorrhaging. Affected animals died within twenty-four hours, with mortality reaching nearly one hundred percent in impacted herds.

**Mechanism Leading to Large-Scale Mortality**

Several ecological and physiological factors contributed to the rapid, large-scale mortality. Saiga antelope calve synchronously, forming dense aggregations of females and newborns, which increases exposure and stress. The combination of high humidity, elevated temperatures, and dense grouping likely compromised immune function and enhanced bacterial activation. Because Pasteurella multocida is an endemic bacterium, every individual was susceptible, and the outbreak occurred almost simultaneously across multiple herds. The speed and severity of infection left no opportunity for behavioral avoidance, natural immunity, or management intervention to mitigate losses.

**Preventive Measures**

Future prevention efforts should focus on anticipating and managing the environmental conditions that promote bacterial outbreaks. This includes continuous monitoring of temperature, humidity, and herd aggregation during calving seasons. Early disease surveillance programs should collect carcass samples and conduct laboratory diagnostics to confirm bacterial activation. In regions with high historical risk, managers could explore limited prophylactic vaccination or temporary herd dispersal during extreme weather. Prompt carcass disposal through burning or deep burial is essential to prevent contamination of soil and water sources.

**Broader Conservation Strategies**

To safeguard Saiga populations from future epizootics, conservation planning must enhance both ecological and population resilience. Maintaining several subpopulations across their range reduces the risk that a single outbreak will cause species-wide collapse. Protecting migration routes and calving areas reduces crowding and stress, which are major contributors to disease expression. Implementing a One Health approach that integrates wildlife, livestock, and human disease surveillance will allow for coordinated monitoring and response. Long-term monitoring using remote sensing and telemetry can help identify climatic and ecological conditions that signal disease risk. Engaging local herders and communities strengthens reporting networks and minimizes human disturbance during calving periods.

**Summary**

The 2015 Saiga mortality event demonstrated how environmental stress can transform a normally harmless bacterium into a fatal pathogen. This outbreak underscores the interconnectedness of climate, host physiology, and microbial ecology. Comprehensive surveillance, habitat protection, and integrated health management are essential to prevent future catastrophic losses and ensure the persistence of Saiga antelope across the Central Asian plain.

**Question 9**

**Explanation:**

R₀ is the average number of secondary infections from one case in a fully susceptible population.

Each illustration represents one infectious flamingo (red) and the number of susceptible flamingos (blue) it infects. Each arrow represents one secondary infection.

**Illustration Number of Secondary Infections**

1             1

2             3

3             2

4             0

**Calculation**

1\. Secondary infections: 1 + 3 + 2 + 0 = 6

2\. Total infectious individuals (red flamingos): 4

3\. Calculate the average number of new infections per infectious host:

   R₀ = 6 / 4 = 1.5

**Explanation**

The calculated R₀ = 1.5 indicates that each infected flamingo, on average, produces 1.5 new infections in a fully susceptible population.

Because R₀ \> 1, the infection has the potential to spread and become established in the population.

If R₀ were \< 1, the infection would likely fade out over time.

# **Worksheet 4: Multi-host pathogens, Spillover**

**1. MERS-CoV is primarily maintained in human populations. (2 points)**

Incorrect

MERS-CoV is not maintained in human populations. The primary reservoir is the camel. Camels harbor the virus endemically and periodically transmit it to humans through direct contact (handling, milking, slaughter) or respiratory droplets.

2.  **Camels serve as the main animal reservoir for MERS-CoV. (2 points)**

    Correct

Camels are the primary animal reservoir for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The virus has been endemic in camel populations across the Arabian Peninsula, North Africa, and parts of East Africa for decades.

3.  **Humans are dead-end hosts for MERS-CoV. (2 points)**

    Correct (Depending on the context)

    In most situations, humans act as dead-end hosts for MERS-CoV because the virus does not circulate sustainably within human populations. Most human infections result from direct contact with infected camels rather than ongoing person-to-person transmission.

    However, limited human-to-human transmission can occur, particularly in healthcare or household settings, where close contact enables spread through respiratory droplets.  Humans are functionally dead-end hosts under natural conditions, but not strictly so, since transmission is possible in specific high-risk environments.

4.  **The estimated case fatality rate for human MERS-CoV infections is approximately 65%. (2 points)**

    Incorrect

    The case fatality rate (CFR) for human MERS-CoV infections is approximately 35%, not 65%. This is based on confirmed cases reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) since the virus was first identified in 2012.

5.  **The epidemic curve indicates this is a point source outbreak. (2 points)**

    Incorrect

    The MERS-CoV epidemic curve does not represent a point source outbreak. A point source outbreak occurs when all cases are exposed to the same infection source at roughly the same time, producing a sharp, single peak followed by a rapid decline

**Worksheet 5: Community Epidemiology Framework**

**Marburg Virus Outbreak, Rwanda 2024**

The first person to become infected in the current Marburg virus outbreak in Rwanda probably contracted the disease during a visit to a cave with Egyptian rousette bats/fruit bats that are known reservoir of Marburg virus. As of 19 December 2024, 66 cases of Marburg virus infection were documented, and most of the people infected were health care workers, mainly those who worked in intensive care units. ​

​1. Using the community epidemiology framework developed by Fenton and Pedersen, would you classify this Marburg virus outbreak as a spillover event or an emerging infectious disease? Justify your classification.                                                **5 points**

Using the community epidemiology framework developed by Fenton and Pedersen (2005), the 2024 Marburg virus outbreak in Rwanda is best classified as an emerging infectious disease rather than a single spillover event. The first human infection likely occurred after exposure to Egyptian rousette bats (*Rousettus aegyptiacus*), which serve as the natural reservoir for Marburg virus. This initial case represents a classic spillover, direct transmission from the wildlife reservoir (H₁) to a novel host (H₂).

However, the outbreak expanded beyond that initial exposure. Most of the 66 confirmed cases were health-care workers, primarily those in intensive care units, demonstrating sustained human-to-human transmission within the H₂ population. In the Fenton and Pedersen continuum, this pattern supports with Case 3, a “true multi-host pathogen,” characterized by limited between-species transmission (bats to humans) but high within-species transmission among humans. This transition from a zoonotic spillover to localized amplification reflects the ecological progression of an emerging infectious disease.

The Marburg outbreak illustrates how pathogens can cross species barriers and achieve temporary persistence in human populations when ecological and behavioral conditions, such as health-care exposure, permitted transmission. It demonstrates the importance of controlling infection at the human–wildlife interface and within community settings to prevent a spillover from becoming an emerging disease.

2\. What measures could be implemented to reduce the risk of transmission in both community and healthcare settings?                                                              **5 points**

Reducing Marburg virus transmission requires coordinated actions that address both community-level exposure and health-care transmission risks.

At the community level, the primary goal is to prevent initial spillover from wildlife reservoirs. Education campaigns should focus on minimizing direct contact with Egyptian rousette bats and avoiding entry into known roosting caves. Community leaders, hunters, and tourism guides play key roles in risk communication, especially in regions where bat colonies and humans overlap. Safe burial practices and culturally sensitive guidance on handling bodies are essential to reduce secondary transmission from deceased individuals.

In health-care settings, infection prevention and control must be immediate and strict. Health-care workers should use standard, contact, and droplet precautions, including gowns, gloves, N95 masks, and face shields, when caring for suspected or confirmed cases. Training and reinforcement of donning and doffing procedures are critical to prevent accidental exposure. Isolation units should be used to separate confirmed patients, and all medical waste and contaminated materials must be disinfected or incinerated under biosafety protocols.

As emphasized by Nutt (2025), equitable outbreak response depends on protecting both patients and providers. Providing adequate personal protective equipment, fair compensation, and mental health support for front-line health-care workers builds trust and ensures compliance with safety measures. Strengthening community partnerships, ensuring transparent communication, and respecting local customs all enhance public cooperation and long-term disease control.

Together, these interventions limit both zoonotic spillover and human-to-human amplification, reducing the likelihood that localized outbreaks evolve into broader epidemics.

**Fisher’s exact test:** p = 0.1987

The prevalence of *Vertico* infection was **30.0 %** (95 % CI 14.0–52.5 %) in Pond 1 and **6.7 %** (95 % CI 0.3–30.2 %) in Pond 2.\
Fisher’s exact test yielded **p = 0.1987**, indicating the difference in infection rates between ponds was **not statistically significant** (p \> 0.05).\

Although the point estimate is higher in Pond 1, the wide overlapping confidence intervals suggest the observed variation may reflect sampling error rather than a true ecological difference.

**Worksheet 7: Nipah Virus, Langya Henipavirus & Avian Reovirus**

**Nipah Virus**

Nipah virus ecology varies across regions, resulting in distinct patterns of transmission in places like Malaysia and Bangladesh. Describe how the modes of transmission differ between these two regions and explain how these differences influence the preventive measures recommended in each setting.                                                        **8 points**

Nipah virus shows different transmission patterns in Malaysia and Bangladesh because each region creates its own ecological pathway for spillover. In Malaysia, the presentation shows that changes in farming practices and rezoning brought fruit bats into closer contact with livestock. Domestic animals, especially pigs, acted as bridge species, allowing the virus to move from bats into herds and then into the people who worked around them. This makes the Malaysian system a more indirect transmission route—bat to livestock, then livestock to humans.

In Bangladesh, the presentation highlights a different pattern. Here, climate variation influences bat migration, and seasonal behavior brings bats directly into contact with human food sources. The most important example shown is the date palm sap harvest, where bats feed from collection pots at night. This creates a more direct bat-to-human transmission route because people consume sap that bats have contaminated.

These differences shape how prevention works in each region. In Malaysia, the emphasis is on changing farming practices, reducing bat access to livestock, and managing land-use decisions that create contact between bats and domestic animals. In Bangladesh, prevention focuses on reducing direct human exposure to bat-contaminated food sources and recognizing how seasonal bat movement, driven by climate, shapes risk. Each region’s ecology guides which preventive measures are most effective.

**Avian Reovirus**

Avian reoviruses (ARV) can be transmitted through multiple routes. Describe the different transmission routes of ARV and explain which environmental factors favor its transmission. What pathogen characteristics support one of these transmission routes? Finally, provide an example of a wild bird disease caused by ARV and briefly describe its impact on the affected population.                                                              **6 points**

Avian reoviruses (ARV) transmit through both horizontal and vertical routes. Horizontal transmission occurs through the fecal–oral route, where birds become infected by ingesting contaminated litter, feed, water, or surfaces. Vertical transmission happens when infection passes from the breeder hen to the chick through the egg.

Environmental factors that favor ARV transmission include poor litter hygiene, overcrowding, inadequate ventilation, and contaminated feed or water. The virus can persist for weeks in litter and on contaminated surfaces, so conditions with high humidity, poor sanitation, and multi-age housing make spread more likely.

Pathogen characteristics that support transmission include the virus’s environmental stability—ARV is resilient and can survive for extended periods outside the host. This stability helps maintain horizontal (fecal–oral) transmission because the virus remains infectious in litter, dust, and on surfaces long enough to reach new hosts.

Example of a wild bird disease caused by ARV, from the presentation: Reovirus infections in wild birds can cause lameness and swollen joints, like the clinical signs shown in domestic birds. These signs reduce the birds’ mobility and overall fitness, leading to poor growth and making affected individuals less competitive or more vulnerable.

**Langya henipavirus**

Langya henipavirus (LayV) is an emerging zoonotic virus first identified in China. Describe the likely reservoir and transmission route of Langya virus. Why is LayV classified as a spillover and not a potential EID?                                           **6 points**

Langya virus is a zoonotic henipavirus whose natural reservoir is the shrew, with transmission occurring through direct or indirect contact with infected animals in rural environments. All human cases represent isolated spillover events, with no person-to-person spread, no geographic expansion, and no new cases since 2021. Because of this, LayV is considered a spillover infection rather than a potential EID, as it lacks evidence of sustained transmission, increasing incidence, or epidemic potential.

**Worksheet 8 – Baylisascaris procyonis Analysis in Raccoons**

**WILD 6200 – Disease Ecology Lecture 15**

**Methods**

Raccoon necropsy data from Missouri and Arkansas (WS7_data.csv; N = 106) were organized by region (North, Central, South), sex (male, female), and age class (adult, young adult). For each comparison, I created separate .csv files containing a single column of worm counts (num_Bpro), where 0 indicated an uninfected raccoon and any positive integer represented the number of Baylisascaris procyonis worms recovered. Files were grouped by category to allow direct comparison of prevalence between regions, sexes, and age classes.

All statistical analyses were performed using Quantitative Parasitology on the Web (QPweb). Group comparisons were run using the “Comparison of Prevalences (Fisher’s exact test)” module.

QPweb does not allow manual selection of a confidence-interval method within the multi-group comparison module. Although the Sterne exact method is available in the single sample “Prevalence” module, all confidence intervals used in this analysis are the exact binomial intervals automatically generated by QPweb during multi-group comparisons.

Age-class comparisons were conducted only for the North and South regions. The Central region contained only one young-adult raccoon, preventing reliable prevalence estimation and invalidating Fisher’s exact test due to extreme imbalance in sample size. Limiting the analysis to regions with adequate sample sizes ensured that statistical comparisons were valid and interpretable.

**Results and Discussion**

**1. Regional Comparison**

Results: Prevalence of Baylisascaris procyonis infection differed significantly among the three regions (Fisher’s exact, p = 0.0016). Infection prevalence was highest in the Central (64.3%) and South (62.8%) regions and lowest in the North (28.6%), demonstrating a clear geographic gradient in infection risk.

Discussion: The spatial pattern likely reflects regional ecological differences that influence exposure and transmission. Higher prevalence in the Central and South regions may result from greater raccoon density, more frequent use of communal latrines, and higher levels of environmental contamination. The lower prevalence in the North region may indicate reduced environmental contamination, fewer intermediate hosts, or habitat features that limit exposure.

The significant Fisher’s exact test supports a true ecological difference rather than an artifact of unequal sample sizes. This pattern emphasizes the role of landscape-level variation in shaping transmission risk in raccoon roundworm systems.

**2. Sex Comparison Across Regions**

Results: Across all regions combined, infection prevalence differed significantly between males and females (Fisher’s exact, p \< 0.0001). Females consistently showed higher infection levels, reaching 100% prevalence in both the Central and South regions. In the North region, females had 38.1% prevalence compared to 21.4% in males, following the same trend.

Discussion: Higher infection prevalence in females likely reflects behaviorally driven exposure differences. Female raccoons exhibit strong site fidelity, repeatedly using dens and communal latrines where eggs accumulate. Males typically have larger home ranges and spend less time in specific contaminated areas, reducing exposure.

The consistency of the sex effect across regions indicates a biological pattern, not a geographically driven one. These results align with established ecological understanding that female raccoons—especially during denning and rearing—experience elevated exposure to parasite-contaminated environments.

**3. Age-Class Comparison (North and South Only)**

Results: Age-class comparisons were restricted to the North and South regions because the Central region contained only one young-adult raccoon.

In the North, adults and young adults showed nearly identical prevalence (28.0% vs. 29.2%), indicating no age-related difference.

In the South, adults showed higher prevalence (67.7%) than young adults (50.0%), though both groups displayed high infection levels.

When age classes were evaluated across both regions combined, Fisher’s exact test indicated a significant difference (p = 0.0075), driven primarily by the age-related separation observed in the South.

Discussion: The similar infection levels in adults and young adults in the North suggest a shared exposure environment, consistent with lower environmental contamination and relatively homogeneous habitat use. In contrast, the South region exhibits a more intuitive age-related pattern: adults show higher prevalence due to cumulative exposure, repeated contact with contaminated latrines, and broader foraging ranges.

The significant Fisher’s test reflects regional differences in transmission intensity, not a universal age effect. Excluding the Central region ensured that age-based comparisons were supported by adequate sample sizes and avoided overinterpretation of limited data.

**Final Analysis**

Across all analyses, Baylisascaris procyonis prevalence in raccoons was shaped by a combination of regional variation, sex-specific behavior, and age-structured patterns of exposure. The strongest drivers of infection were geography and sex, with age effects emerging only in areas with high environmental contamination.

This dataset demonstrates how raccoon ecology, landscape structure, and behavioral patterns interact to influence parasitic worm transmission across populations.
