Worksheet 2 Sample size for disease detection

![](Probability%20of%20detecting%20one%20positive.jpg)

1\) Find the sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a herd of 5000 deer. The desired level of confidence is 95%. 

Answer: (59) ≈ 60

2\) Using the hypergeometric distribution, compare the sample size requirements for the following scenarios:                                                                                      

a\) 95% confidence in detecting a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population

Answer: (290) ≈ 300

b\) 99% confidence in detecting a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population

Answer: (224) ≈ 230

3\) You sample 300 deer from a high fenced facility that has a herd of 4000. None of the 300 deer have antibodies against Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease. Based on this finding, you are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is \< 1%.

**Worksheet 3: Measures of disease frequency: Prevalence and Incidence**

a\) Find incidence on day 06/12/25, 06/14/25 and 06/15/25. Write the unit for incidence. (9 points)     

06-12-25: 5 new cases

5/(56-5) = 9.8 % per day

06-13-25: 2 new cases

2/(51-2) = 4.1 % per day

06-14-25: 2 new cases

2/(49-2) = 4.3 % per day

06-15-25: 0 new cases

b\) What is the prevalence of conjunctivitis on 06/13/25 and 06/16/25? What is the unit for prevalence.   (5 points)       

06/13/25: 12 cases / 56 = 0.2143 = 21.43%

06/16/25: 5 cases / 56 = 0.0893 = 8.93%

c\) On which day is the prevalence same as the incidence (except the units)? (3 points)

On 06/10/25, prevalence = 1 case and incidence = 1 new case.

Although units differ, the numeric values were equal.

d\) On which day is the incidence lowest?  (3 points)

The lowest incidence occurred on 06/15/25 (and also on 06/16/25), with 0 new cases.

**Identifying Ticks and Public Health Significance**

Key external features of hard ticks (family *Ixodidae*) are visible with a hand lens or low-power microscope. These ticks possess a rigid dorsal shield (scutum), which partially covers the back in females and the entire dorsum in males. Their mouthparts (capitulum) project forward from the front of the body, and both nymphs and adults have eight legs but lack antennae. Additional traits include the position of the anal groove, presence of spiracular plates, and visibility of eyes or festoons. These can help distinguish among genera. These structural markers are useful for identifying common North American species, including *Ixodes scapularis* (black-legged tick), Dermacentor variabilis (American dog tick), and *Amblyomma americanum* (lone star tick) (Keirans & Litwak, 1989).

Ticks in the United States can transmit a range of pathogens These include bacteria, viruses, and parasites. These can lead to serious illnesses in humans. Among the most prevalent tickborne diseases are Lyme disease, anaplasmosis, ehrlichiosis, babesiosis, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and Powassan virus disease (CDC, 2024a). Each year, U.S. health departments report more than 46,000 cases of these infections (CDC, 2024b). As tick populations expand, the risk of exposure increases—even in regions where certain species were previously uncommon (CDC, 2024c). To reduce the chance of infection, the CDC advises using EPA-registered insect repellents, wearing protective clothing such as long sleeves and pants, performing thorough tick checks after outdoor activities, and removing any attached ticks promptly and properly (CDC, 2024d).

# **Midterm Corrections**

Dear Dr. Belsare,

Thank you for the opportunity to submit corrections. I reviewed all questions where partial credit was deducted and made appropriate revisions. For your reference, I’ve included my corrected responses to Questions 7 and 9 below.

**Question 7**

In May 2015, a catastrophic die-off of Saiga antelope occurred in central Kazakhstan, resulting in the deaths of more than 200,000 individuals in less than two weeks. This event remains one of the most severe wildlife mortality incidents ever recorded. Understanding the proximate cause, environmental triggers, and ecological mechanisms provides valuable insight into wildlife disease ecology and future conservation planning. (20 points)

**Proximate Cause**

The immediate cause of death was hemorrhagic septicemia, triggered by the normally benign bacterium *Pasteurella multocida* type B. Under ordinary conditions, this bacterium exists harmlessly in the tonsils and upper respiratory tract of Saiga. During the 2015 calving season, unusually warm and humid weather created ideal conditions for bacterial proliferation and virulence activation. Once systemic infection occurred, the bacteria spread rapidly through the bloodstream, causing acute septicemia and internal hemorrhaging. Affected animals died within twenty-four hours, with mortality reaching nearly one hundred percent in impacted herds.

**Mechanism Leading to Large-Scale Mortality**

Several ecological and physiological factors contributed to the rapid, large-scale mortality. Saiga antelope calve synchronously, forming dense aggregations of females and newborns, which increases exposure and stress. The combination of high humidity, elevated temperatures, and dense grouping likely compromised immune function and enhanced bacterial activation. Because Pasteurella multocida is an endemic bacterium, every individual was susceptible, and the outbreak occurred almost simultaneously across multiple herds. The speed and severity of infection left no opportunity for behavioral avoidance, natural immunity, or management intervention to mitigate losses.

**Preventive Measures**

Future prevention efforts should focus on anticipating and managing the environmental conditions that promote bacterial outbreaks. This includes continuous monitoring of temperature, humidity, and herd aggregation during calving seasons. Early disease surveillance programs should collect carcass samples and conduct laboratory diagnostics to confirm bacterial activation. In regions with high historical risk, managers could explore limited prophylactic vaccination or temporary herd dispersal during extreme weather. Prompt carcass disposal through burning or deep burial is essential to prevent contamination of soil and water sources.

**Broader Conservation Strategies**

To safeguard Saiga populations from future epizootics, conservation planning must enhance both ecological and population resilience. Maintaining several subpopulations across their range reduces the risk that a single outbreak will cause species-wide collapse. Protecting migration routes and calving areas reduces crowding and stress, which are major contributors to disease expression. Implementing a One Health approach that integrates wildlife, livestock, and human disease surveillance will allow for coordinated monitoring and response. Long-term monitoring using remote sensing and telemetry can help identify climatic and ecological conditions that signal disease risk. Engaging local herders and communities strengthens reporting networks and minimizes human disturbance during calving periods.

**Summary**

The 2015 Saiga mortality event demonstrated how environmental stress can transform a normally harmless bacterium into a fatal pathogen. This outbreak underscores the interconnectedness of climate, host physiology, and microbial ecology. Comprehensive surveillance, habitat protection, and integrated health management are essential to prevent future catastrophic losses and ensure the persistence of Saiga antelope across the Central Asian plain.

**Question 9**

**Explanation:**

R₀ is the average number of secondary infections from one case in a fully susceptible population.

Each illustration represents one infectious flamingo (red) and the number of susceptible flamingos (blue) it infects. Each arrow represents one secondary infection.

**Illustration Number of Secondary Infections**

1             1

2             3

3             2

4             0

**Calculation**

1\. Secondary infections: 1 + 3 + 2 + 0 = 6

2\. Total infectious individuals (red flamingos): 4

3\. Calculate the average number of new infections per infectious host:

   R₀ = 6 / 4 = 1.5

**Explanation**

The calculated R₀ = 1.5 indicates that each infected flamingo, on average, produces 1.5 new infections in a fully susceptible population.

Because R₀ \> 1, the infection has the potential to spread and become established in the population.

If R₀ were \< 1, the infection would likely fade out over time.
