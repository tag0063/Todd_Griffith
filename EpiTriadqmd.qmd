## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

Worksheet 2 Sample size for disease detection

1) Find the sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a herd of 5000 deer. The desired level of confidence is 95%. 

Answer: (59) ≈ 60

2) Using the hypergeometric distribution, compare the sample size requirements for the following scenarios:                                                                                      

a) 95% confidence in detecting a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population

Answer: (290) ≈ 300

b) 99% confidence in detecting a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population

Answer: (224) ≈ 230

3) You sample 300 deer from a high fenced facility that has a herd of 4000. None of the 300 deer have antibodies against Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease. Based on this finding, you are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is < 1%.
