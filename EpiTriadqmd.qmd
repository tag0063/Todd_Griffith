**Identifying Ticks and Public Health Significance**

Key external features of hard ticks (family *Ixodidae*) are visible with a hand lens or low-power microscope. These ticks possess a rigid dorsal shield (scutum), which partially covers the back in females and the entire dorsum in males. Their mouthparts (capitulum) project forward from the front of the body, and both nymphs and adults have eight legs but lack antennae. Additional traits include the position of the anal groove, presence of spiracular plates, and visibility of eyes or festoons. These can help distinguish among genera. These structural markers are useful for identifying common North American species, including *Ixodes scapularis* (black-legged tick), Dermacentor variabilis (American dog tick), and *Amblyomma americanum* (lone star tick) (Keirans & Litwak, 1989).

Ticks in the United States can transmit a range of pathogens These include bacteria, viruses, and parasites. These can lead to serious illnesses in humans. Among the most prevalent tickborne diseases are Lyme disease, anaplasmosis, ehrlichiosis, babesiosis, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and Powassan virus disease (CDC, 2024a). Each year, U.S. health departments report more than 46,000 cases of these infections (CDC, 2024b). As tick populations expand, the risk of exposure increases—even in regions where certain species were previously uncommon (CDC, 2024c). To reduce the chance of infection, the CDC advises using EPA-registered insect repellents, wearing protective clothing such as long sleeves and pants, performing thorough tick checks after outdoor activities, and removing any attached ticks promptly and properly (CDC, 2024d).

**Midterm Corrections**

Dear Dr. Belsare,

Thank you for the opportunity to submit corrections. I reviewed all questions where partial credit was deducted and made appropriate revisions. For your reference, I’ve included my corrected responses to Questions 7 and 9 below.

**Question 7**

In May 2015, a catastrophic die-off of Saiga antelope occurred in central Kazakhstan, resulting in the deaths of more than 200,000 individuals in less than two weeks. This event remains one of the most severe wildlife mortality incidents ever recorded. Understanding the proximate cause, environmental triggers, and ecological mechanisms provides valuable insight into wildlife disease ecology and future conservation planning. (20 points)

**Proximate Cause**

The immediate cause of death was hemorrhagic septicemia, triggered by the normally benign bacterium *Pasteurella multocida* type B. Under ordinary conditions, this bacterium exists harmlessly in the tonsils and upper respiratory tract of Saiga. During the 2015 calving season, unusually warm and humid weather created ideal conditions for bacterial proliferation and virulence activation. Once systemic infection occurred, the bacteria spread rapidly through the bloodstream, causing acute septicemia and internal hemorrhaging. Affected animals died within twenty-four hours, with mortality reaching nearly one hundred percent in impacted herds.

**Mechanism Leading to Large-Scale Mortality**

Several ecological and physiological factors contributed to the rapid, large-scale mortality. Saiga antelope calve synchronously, forming dense aggregations of females and newborns, which increases exposure and stress. The combination of high humidity, elevated temperatures, and dense grouping likely compromised immune function and enhanced bacterial activation. Because Pasteurella multocida is an endemic bacterium, every individual was susceptible, and the outbreak occurred almost simultaneously across multiple herds. The speed and severity of infection left no opportunity for behavioral avoidance, natural immunity, or management intervention to mitigate losses.

**Preventive Measures**

Future prevention efforts should focus on anticipating and managing the environmental conditions that promote bacterial outbreaks. This includes continuous monitoring of temperature, humidity, and herd aggregation during calving seasons. Early disease surveillance programs should collect carcass samples and conduct laboratory diagnostics to confirm bacterial activation. In regions with high historical risk, managers could explore limited prophylactic vaccination or temporary herd dispersal during extreme weather. Prompt carcass disposal through burning or deep burial is essential to prevent contamination of soil and water sources.

**Broader Conservation Strategies**

To safeguard Saiga populations from future epizootics, conservation planning must enhance both ecological and population resilience. Maintaining several subpopulations across their range reduces the risk that a single outbreak will cause species-wide collapse. Protecting migration routes and calving areas reduces crowding and stress, which are major contributors to disease expression. Implementing a One Health approach that integrates wildlife, livestock, and human disease surveillance will allow for coordinated monitoring and response. Long-term monitoring using remote sensing and telemetry can help identify climatic and ecological conditions that signal disease risk. Engaging local herders and communities strengthens reporting networks and minimizes human disturbance during calving periods.

**Summary**

The 2015 Saiga mortality event demonstrated how environmental stress can transform a normally harmless bacterium into a fatal pathogen. This outbreak underscores the interconnectedness of climate, host physiology, and microbial ecology. Comprehensive surveillance, habitat protection, and integrated health management are essential to prevent future catastrophic losses and ensure the persistence of Saiga antelope across the Central Asian plain.

**Question 9**

**Explanation:**

R₀ is the average number of secondary infections from one case in a fully susceptible population.

Each illustration represents one infectious flamingo (red) and the number of susceptible flamingos (blue) it infects. Each arrow represents one secondary infection.

**Illustration Number of Secondary Infections**

1             1

2             3

3             2

4             0

**Calculation**

1\. Secondary infections: 1 + 3 + 2 + 0 = 6

2\. Total infectious individuals (red flamingos): 4

3\. Calculate the average number of new infections per infectious host:

   R₀ = 6 / 4 = 1.5

**Explanation**

The calculated R₀ = 1.5 indicates that each infected flamingo, on average, produces 1.5 new infections in a fully susceptible population.

Because R₀ \> 1, the infection has the potential to spread and become established in the population.

If R₀ were \< 1, the infection would likely fade out over time.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Worksheet 4: Multi-host pathogens, Spillover**

1\. MERS-CoV is primarily maintained in human populations.

Incorrect

MERS-CoV is not maintained in human populations. The primary reservoir is the camel. Camels harbor the virus endemically and periodically transmit it to humans through direct contact (handling, milking, slaughter) or respiratory droplets.

2\. Camels serve as the main animal reservoir for MERS-CoV.

Correct

Camels are the primary animal reservoir for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The virus has been endemic in camel populations across the Arabian Peninsula, North Africa, and parts of East Africa for decades.

3\. Humans are dead-end hosts for MERS-CoV.

Correct (Depending on the context)

In most situations, humans act as dead-end hosts for MERS-CoV because the virus does not circulate sustainably within human populations. Most human infections result from direct contact with infected camels rather than ongoing person-to-person transmission.

However, limited human-to-human transmission can occur, particularly in healthcare or household settings, where close contact enables spread through respiratory droplets.  Humans are functionally dead-end hosts under natural conditions, but not strictly so, since transmission is possible in specific high-risk environments.

4\. The estimated case fatality rate for human MERS-CoV infections is approximately 65%.

Incorrect

The case fatality rate (CFR) for human MERS-CoV infections is approximately 35%, not 65%. This is based on confirmed cases reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) since the virus was first identified in 2012.

5\. The epidemic curve indicates this is a point source outbreak.

Incorrect

The MERS-CoV epidemic curve does not represent a point source outbreak. A point source outbreak occurs when all cases are exposed to the same infection source at roughly the same time, producing a sharp, single peak followed by a rapid decline

**Worksheet 5: Community Epidemiology Framework**

**Marburg Virus Outbreak, Rwanda 2024**

The first person to become infected in the current Marburg virus outbreak in Rwanda probably contracted the disease during a visit to a cave with Egyptian rousette bats/fruit bats that are known reservoir of Marburg virus. As of 19 December 2024, 66 cases of Marburg virus infection were documented, and most of the people infected were health care workers, mainly those who worked in intensive care units. ​

​1. Using the community epidemiology framework developed by Fenton and Pedersen, would you classify this Marburg virus outbreak as a spillover event or an emerging infectious disease? Justify your classification.

Using the community epidemiology framework developed by Fenton and Pedersen (2005), the 2024 Marburg virus outbreak in Rwanda is best classified as an emerging infectious disease rather than a single spillover event. The first human infection likely occurred after exposure to Egyptian rousette bats (*Rousettus aegyptiacus*), which serve as the natural reservoir for Marburg virus. This initial case represents a classic spillover, direct transmission from the wildlife reservoir (H₁) to a novel host (H₂).

However, the outbreak expanded beyond that initial exposure. Most of the 66 confirmed cases were health-care workers, primarily those in intensive care units, demonstrating sustained human-to-human transmission within the H₂ population. In the Fenton and Pedersen continuum, this pattern supports with Case 3, a “true multi-host pathogen,” characterized by limited between-species transmission (bats to humans) but high within-species transmission among humans. This transition from a zoonotic spillover to localized amplification reflects the ecological progression of an emerging infectious disease.

The Marburg outbreak illustrates how pathogens can cross species barriers and achieve temporary persistence in human populations when ecological and behavioral conditions, such as health-care exposure, permitted transmission. It demonstrates the importance of controlling infection at the human–wildlife interface and within community settings to prevent a spillover from becoming an emerging disease.

2\. What measures could be implemented to reduce the risk of transmission in both community and healthcare settings?

Reducing Marburg virus transmission requires coordinated actions that address both community-level exposure and health-care transmission risks.

At the community level, the primary goal is to prevent initial spillover from wildlife reservoirs. Education campaigns should focus on minimizing direct contact with Egyptian rousette bats and avoiding entry into known roosting caves. Community leaders, hunters, and tourism guides play key roles in risk communication, especially in regions where bat colonies and humans overlap. Safe burial practices and culturally sensitive guidance on handling bodies are essential to reduce secondary transmission from deceased individuals.

In health-care settings, infection prevention and control must be immediate and strict. Health-care workers should use standard, contact, and droplet precautions, including gowns, gloves, N95 masks, and face shields, when caring for suspected or confirmed cases. Training and reinforcement of donning and doffing procedures are critical to prevent accidental exposure. Isolation units should be used to separate confirmed patients, and all medical waste and contaminated materials must be disinfected or incinerated under biosafety protocols.

As emphasized by Nutt (2025), equitable outbreak response depends on protecting both patients and providers. Providing adequate personal protective equipment, fair compensation, and mental health support for front-line health-care workers builds trust and ensures compliance with safety measures. Strengthening community partnerships, ensuring transparent communication, and respecting local customs all enhance public cooperation and long-term disease control.

Together, these interventions limit both zoonotic spillover and human-to-human amplification, reducing the likelihood that localized outbreaks evolve into broader epidemics.

**Fisher’s exact test:** p = 0.1987

The prevalence of *Vertico* infection was **30.0 %** (95 % CI 14.0–52.5 %) in Pond 1 and **6.7 %** (95 % CI 0.3–30.2 %) in Pond 2.\
\

Fisher’s exact test yielded **p = 0.1987**, indicating the difference in infection rates between ponds was **not statistically significant** (p \> 0.05).

Although the point estimate is higher in Pond 1, the wide overlapping confidence intervals suggest the observed variation may reflect sampling error rather than a true ecological difference.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Worksheet 7: Nipah Virus, Langya Henipavirus & Avian Reovirus**

**Nipah Virus**

Nipah virus ecology varies across regions, resulting in distinct patterns of transmission in places like Malaysia and Bangladesh. Describe how the modes of transmission differ between these two regions and explain how these differences influence the preventive measures recommended in each setting.

Nipah virus shows different transmission patterns in Malaysia and Bangladesh because each region creates its own ecological pathway for spillover. In Malaysia, the presentation shows that changes in farming practices and rezoning brought fruit bats into closer contact with livestock. Domestic animals, especially pigs, acted as bridge species, allowing the virus to move from bats into herds and then into the people who worked around them. This makes the Malaysian system a more indirect transmission route—bat to livestock, then livestock to humans.

In Bangladesh, the presentation highlights a different pattern. Here, climate variation influences bat migration, and seasonal behavior brings bats directly into contact with human food sources. The most important example shown is the date palm sap harvest, where bats feed from collection pots at night. This creates a more direct bat-to-human transmission route because people consume sap that bats have contaminated.

These differences shape how prevention works in each region. In Malaysia, the emphasis is on changing farming practices, reducing bat access to livestock, and managing land-use decisions that create contact between bats and domestic animals. In Bangladesh, prevention focuses on reducing direct human exposure to bat-contaminated food sources and recognizing how seasonal bat movement, driven by climate, shapes risk. Each region’s ecology guides which preventive measures are most effective.

**Avian Reovirus**

Avian reoviruses (ARV) can be transmitted through multiple routes. Describe the different transmission routes of ARV and explain which environmental factors favor its transmission. What pathogen characteristics support one of these transmission routes? Finally, provide an example of a wild bird disease caused by ARV and briefly describe its impact on the affected population.

Avian reoviruses (ARV) transmit through both horizontal and vertical routes. Horizontal transmission occurs through the fecal–oral route, where birds become infected by ingesting contaminated litter, feed, water, or surfaces. Vertical transmission happens when infection passes from the breeder hen to the chick through the egg.

Environmental factors that favor ARV transmission include poor litter hygiene, overcrowding, inadequate ventilation, and contaminated feed or water. The virus can persist for weeks in litter and on contaminated surfaces, so conditions with high humidity, poor sanitation, and multi-age housing make spread more likely.

Pathogen characteristics that support transmission include the virus’s environmental stability—ARV is resilient and can survive for extended periods outside the host. This stability helps maintain horizontal (fecal–oral) transmission because the virus remains infectious in litter, dust, and on surfaces long enough to reach new hosts.

Example of a wild bird disease caused by ARV, from the presentation: Reovirus infections in wild birds can cause lameness and swollen joints, like the clinical signs shown in domestic birds. These signs reduce the birds’ mobility and overall fitness, leading to poor growth and making affected individuals less competitive or more vulnerable.

**Langya henipavirus**

Langya henipavirus (LayV) is an emerging zoonotic virus first identified in China. Describe the likely reservoir and transmission route of Langya virus. Why is LayV classified as a spillover and not a potential EID?

Langya virus is a zoonotic henipavirus whose natural reservoir is the shrew, with transmission occurring through direct or indirect contact with infected animals in rural environments. All human cases represent isolated spillover events, with no person-to-person spread, no geographic expansion, and no new cases since 2021. Because of this, LayV is considered a spillover infection rather than a potential EID, as it lacks evidence of sustained transmission, increasing incidence, or epidemic potential.

**Worksheet 8 – *Baylisascaris procyonis* Analysis in Raccoons**

**WILD 6200 – Disease Ecology Lecture 15**

**Methods**

Raccoon necropsy data from Missouri and Arkansas (WS7_data.csv; N = 106) were organized by region (North, Central, South), sex (male, female), and age class (adult, young adult). For each comparison, I created separate .csv files containing a single column of worm counts (num_Bpro), where 0 indicated an uninfected raccoon and any positive integer represented the number of *Baylisascaris procyonis* worms recovered. Files were grouped by category to allow direct comparison of prevalence between regions, sexes, and age classes.

All statistical analyses were performed using Quantitative Parasitology on the Web (QPweb). Group comparisons were run using the “Comparison of Prevalences (Fisher’s exact test)” module.

QPweb does not allow manual selection of a confidence-interval method within the multi-group comparison module. Although the Sterne exact method is available in the single sample “Prevalence” module, all confidence intervals used in this analysis are the exact binomial intervals automatically generated by QPweb during multi-group comparisons.

Age-class comparisons were conducted only for the North and South regions. The Central region contained only one young-adult raccoon, preventing reliable prevalence estimation and invalidating Fisher’s exact test due to extreme imbalance in sample size. Limiting the analysis to regions with adequate sample sizes ensured that statistical comparisons were valid and interpretable.

**Results and Discussion**

**1. Regional Comparison**

Results: Prevalence of Baylisascaris procyonis infection differed significantly among the three regions (Fisher’s exact, p = 0.0016). Infection prevalence was highest in the Central (64.3%) and South (62.8%) regions and lowest in the North (28.6%), demonstrating a clear geographic gradient in infection risk.

Discussion: The spatial pattern likely reflects regional ecological differences that influence exposure and transmission. Higher prevalence in the Central and South regions may result from greater raccoon density, more frequent use of communal latrines, and higher levels of environmental contamination. The lower prevalence in the North region may indicate reduced environmental contamination, fewer intermediate hosts, or habitat features that limit exposure.

The significant Fisher’s exact test supports a true ecological difference rather than an artifact of unequal sample sizes. This pattern emphasizes the role of landscape-level variation in shaping transmission risk in raccoon roundworm systems.

**2. Sex Comparison Across Regions**

Results: Across all regions combined, infection prevalence differed significantly between males and females (Fisher’s exact, p \< 0.0001). Females consistently showed higher infection levels, reaching 100% prevalence in both the Central and South regions. In the North region, females had 38.1% prevalence compared to 21.4% in males, following the same trend.

Discussion: Higher infection prevalence in females likely reflects behaviorally driven exposure differences. Female raccoons exhibit strong site fidelity, repeatedly using dens and communal latrines where eggs accumulate. Males typically have larger home ranges and spend less time in specific contaminated areas, reducing exposure.

The consistency of the sex effect across regions indicates a biological pattern, not a geographically driven one. These results align with established ecological understanding that female raccoons—especially during denning and rearing—experience elevated exposure to parasite-contaminated environments.

**3. Age-Class Comparison (North and South Only)**

Results: Age-class comparisons were restricted to the North and South regions because the Central region contained only one young-adult raccoon.

In the North, adults and young adults showed nearly identical prevalence (28.0% vs. 29.2%), indicating no age-related difference.

In the South, adults showed higher prevalence (67.7%) than young adults (50.0%), though both groups displayed high infection levels.

When age classes were evaluated across both regions combined, Fisher’s exact test indicated a significant difference (p = 0.0075), driven primarily by the age-related separation observed in the South.

Discussion: The similar infection levels in adults and young adults in the North suggest a shared exposure environment, consistent with lower environmental contamination and relatively homogeneous habitat use. In contrast, the South region exhibits a more intuitive age-related pattern: adults show higher prevalence due to cumulative exposure, repeated contact with contaminated latrines, and broader foraging ranges.

The significant Fisher’s test reflects regional differences in transmission intensity, not a universal age effect. Excluding the Central region ensured that age-based comparisons were supported by adequate sample sizes and avoided overinterpretation of limited data.

**Final Analysis**

Across all analyses, Baylisascaris procyonis prevalence in raccoons was shaped by a combination of regional variation, sex-specific behavior, and age-structured patterns of exposure. The strongest drivers of infection were geography and sex, with age effects emerging only in areas with high environmental contamination.

This dataset demonstrates how raccoon ecology, landscape structure, and behavioral patterns interact to influence parasitic worm transmission across populations.

**Worksheet 9**

In 2024, a multistate Salmonella outbreak was linked to backyard poultry flocks in the  United States. What specific human behaviors contributed to the zoonotic spread of *Salmonella*? In your response, identify at least three practices by backyard poultry owners that increased the risk of Salmonella transmission, and briefly explain why these behaviors facilitated human infection.

Several common behaviors among backyard poultry owners directly increased the risk of zoonotic *Salmonella* transmission:

Frequent, close contact with backyard poultry\
Many people, especially children, handled birds, picked them up, or allowed them near their faces. Because poultry shed *Salmonella* on feathers, feet, and eggshells, direct contact created frequent opportunities for the bacteria to transfer to hands and, eventually, the mouth.

Inadequate hand hygiene after touching birds or contaminated surfaces\
The lecture emphasized poor or inconsistent hand-washing as a major driver of infection. Poultry shed *Salmonella* into litter, soil, and coop surfaces. Without proper handwashing after contact with birds, feed, bedding, or coops, people unintentionally ingested the bacteria.

Allowing young children (\<5 years) to handle birds or play in contaminated areas\
Young children were identified as especially vulnerable in the May 2024 outbreak, with \~43% of cases occurring in this age group. Children have frequented hand-to-mouth behaviors, limited hygiene, and are often allowed to pet or play around poultry, making exposure more likely.

These behaviors increased human infection by creating direct or indirect pathways for *Salmonella* to move from birds → environment → hands → mouth. The outbreak highlighted how human–animal contact, environmental contamination, and hygiene practices interact to drive zoonotic transmission in backyard poultry settings.

Tall fescue grass is commonly infected with a fungal endophyte (*Epichloe coenophiala*) that produces ergot alkaloids associated with fescue toxicosis in grazing livestock.

What advantage does Tall fescue gain from being infected with a fungal endophyte.

Tall fescue gains several ecological benefits from infection with *Epichloe coenophiala*. The endophyte enhances drought and heat tolerance, increases persistence and resistance to grazing pressure, and promotes faster regrowth after defoliation. Endophyte infection also improves nutrient uptake and resilience under environmental stress, giving Tall fescue a competitive advantage over non-infected plants. These benefits explain why tall fescue infected with the endophyte performs better than uninfected plants.

 What environmental and ecological factors drive the occurrence and severity of fescue toxicosis in grazing systems?

The severity of fescue toxicosis is shaped by a combination of climatic, soil, and grazing-system factors. Warm temperatures, drought, and low soil fertility increase alkaloid concentrations and elevate toxicity. Soil microbial communities influence alkaloid breakdown, while heavy grazing pressure increases exposure by forcing cattle to consume stockpiled or stressed plants with higher toxin levels. Environmental stressors on cattle—such as heat load and poor forage quality—further amplify the physiological impacts of ergot alkaloids.

What are the key clinical signs of fescue toxicity in cattle?

Cattle with fescue toxicosis shows reduced weight gain, poor performance, and rough hair coats due to impaired thermoregulation. Affected animals often exhibit heat intolerance, elevated body temperatures, and reduced feed intake. Chronic exposure also contributes to reproductive issues, decreased milk production, and general decline in health and productivity.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Worksheet 10**

1\. What are the different routes of transmission for African Swine fever? What role do humans play in the spread and transmission of ASF?

ASF spreads through several ecological pathways that allow the virus to move efficiently through domestic and wild pig populations. Transmission occurs through soft ticks (*Ornithodoros spp*.), direct pig-to-pig contact with infected blood, saliva, or feces, and indirect exposure through contaminated feed, equipment, transport vehicles, or worker clothing. The virus also persists for extended periods in carcasses and pork products, creating an environmental reservoir that continues to drive outbreaks.

Humans are a major amplifier of ASF transmission through several behaviors:

Humans are major mechanical amplifiers of ASF transmission because they transport infected pigs and pork products, engage in swill feeding, move contaminated equipment between farms, and participate in illegal or unregulated pork trade. Weak surveillance systems and limited compensation in smallholder operations further delay reporting, allowing the virus to spread widely before detection.

2\. Describe how co-infection with Koala retrovirus (KoRV) affects the severity, progression, and management of Chlamydia in koalas.

Co-infection with KoRV suppresses the koala immune system, making chlamydial infections more common, more severe, and harder for the host to control. Koalas carrying KoRV show higher bacterial loads, greater tissue damage, and experience higher mortality and infertility rates because the weakened immune response allows Chlamydia to progress rapidly. This co-infection complicates management because antibiotic treatments are less effective in immunocompromised animals and vaccination or recovery efforts must account for KoRV’s role in driving chronic disease and long-term population decline.

3\. Snake Fungal Disease (SFD), caused by *Ophidiomyces ophiodiicola*, is an emerging threat to wild snake populations in North America.

What are the key challenges associated with the surveillance and management of Snake Fungal Disease (SFD)?

FD is difficult to monitor due to low snake detectability, variable clinical signs, and the need for laboratory confirmation to distinguish true infections. The fungus persists in soil and other substrates, creating environmental reservoirs that continually reinfect snakes and hinder localized management. Because free-ranging snakes cannot be easily treated, contained, or quarantined, large-scale management is limited, and long-term surveillance remains challenging for wildlife agencies.

**WILD 5200/6200 - Disease Ecology Final**

**1. True or False. If false, explain why the statement is incorrect.**

a\. Per the community–epidemiology continuum proposed by Fenton and Pedersen (2005), a disease caused by a pathogen with high between-species transmission and not within–target species transmission will be termed a spillover.

False.

This is false because a spillover requires repeated transmission from the reservoir to the target species and the absence of sustained transmission within the target species. High between-species transmission alone does not define spillover; the defining feature is that the pathogen fails to spread independently within the target population (Lecture 3).

b\. A viral disease that is transmitted to susceptible hosts only by vectors is infectious as well as contagious.

False.

A vector-borne viral disease is infectious because it can establish and replicate in a susceptible host, but it is not contagious because transmission does not occur through direct host-to-host contact. Contagious diseases require horizontal spread through physical interaction, aerosols, or shared environments, none of which apply when vectors are the sole transmission route (Lecture 2).

c\. The eggs of *Baylisascaris procyonis* can be transmitted to humans by direct contact immediately after excretion by an infected raccoon.

False.

*Baylisascaris procyonis* eggs are not immediately infectious when shed by raccoons. They require a period of environmental embryonation, typically 2–4 weeks, before reaching the infective larval stage capable of causing disease in humans or wildlife. Freshly excreted eggs therefore cannot transmit infection (Lecture 10).

d\. A fungus growing on tall fescue leaves is responsible for decreased feed intake in cattle grazing on this grass, resulting in reduced weight gain and lower milk production.

False.

The fungus visible on tall fescue leaves is not what causes decreased feed intake and reduced weight gain in cattle. These symptoms are caused by ergot alkaloids produced by the endophytic fungus *Epichloe coenophiala* living inside the plant. The external leaf fungus is cosmetic; the toxic physiological effects come from alkaloids concentrated in the plant’s tissues, especially the seedheads (Lecture 12).

e\. Northern cardinals are considered superspreaders species for West Nile virus.

False.

Northern cardinals are not superspreaders of West Nile virus. Although they can be infected, they develop low viremia that is insufficient to infect feeding mosquitoes, which means they do not contribute substantially to transmission. True superspreader species for West Nile virus are high-viremia reservoir hosts such as American robins (Turdus migratorius) that efficiently amplify the virus to mosquitoes (Lecture 9).

**2. List the community-based interventions used for preventing dracunculiasis transmission in endemic regions. Explain how each intervention interrupts specific stages of the Guinea worm life cycle. How have these strategies evolved in recent years given the emergence of animal (particularly dog) infections?**

Community-based interventions for dracunculiasis prevention are designed to interrupt the cyclopoid-to-human transmission cycle of Dracunculus medinensis. The Carter Center, working with WHO and national programs, has implemented several coordinated approaches that directly target different points in the parasite’s life cycle (Lecture 7).

\(1\) Safe drinking water:

Providing boreholes, protected wells, and improving access to treated water prevents people from consuming copepods infected with D. medinensis larvae. This intervention blocks the initial ingestion stage of the life cycle, which is the only route by which humans acquire infection.

\(2\) Cloth and pipe filters:

Where safe water is not yet available, distributing and promoting consistent use of cloth filters removes copepods from surface water. This interrupts larval entry into the host, serving as the most immediately scalable mitigation strategy in remote communities.

\(3\) Tethering and case containment:

Once clinical cases emerge, individuals with emerging worms are bandaged and prevented from entering water sources. This prevents release of L1 larvae into ponds, which would otherwise infect copepods and restart the transmission cycle. This method is foundational for breaking community-level transmission.

\(4\) Abate (temephos) application:

Larvicide is applied strategically to contaminated water bodies to kill copepods, reducing the intermediate host population. This suppresses the environmental amplification stage of the life cycle and is especially useful in highly endemic villages.

\(5\) Health education and community surveillance:

Residents are taught how the parasite is transmitted, why patients must not enter water sources, and how to report suspected cases. This strengthens early detection, prevents environmental contamination, and ensures consistent compliance with containment protocols.

Since 2014, the emergence of D. medinensis infections in dogs, particularly in Chad, has required significant adaptation of eradication strategies (Lecture 7).

\(a\) Tethering infected dogs:

Similar to human case containment, tethering prevents infected dogs from entering water bodies during worm emergence, blocking environmental contamination.

\(b\) Safe disposal of fish and fish entrails:

Dogs are believed to acquire infection through consumption of paratenic or transport hosts (e.g., fish or frogs). Community campaigns now emphasize burying fish entrails and preventing dogs from scavenging, an intervention that targets a newly recognized transmission route not present in the classic human-only cycle.

\(c\) Expanded surveillance to animals:

Villages now monitor dogs, cats, and, more recently, baboons. This improves early detection across all potential reservoir hosts, recognizing that eradication is impossible without addressing animal transmission.

\(d\) Incentives for reporting:

Cash rewards for reporting infections in dogs and humans have increased case detection and reduced delays in containment.

The integration of animal-focused programs reflects a shift from a strictly human disease model to a One Health framework, which is now essential for completing eradication.

**3. Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) is an emerging prion disease of cervids and one of the most significant wildlife conservation challenges in North America. What are the main obstacles wildlife agencies face in managing and controlling CWD?**

Wildlife agencies face several major obstacles when managing chronic wasting disease, largely due to the biology of prions, the behavior and ecology of cervids, and the social landscape surrounding deer management (Lecture 17). The first obstacle is that CWD has an extremely long incubation period, often 18–24 months or longer, during which infected deer appear healthy but shed infectious prions in saliva, urine, feces, and carcasses. This prolonged asymptomatic period allows the disease to spread widely before detection, making early containment difficult. Once established, CWD becomes persistent in the landscape, and eradication is effectively impossible.

A second major obstacle is environmental persistence of prions. Misfolded prion proteins resist heat, freezing, ultraviolet light, and most disinfectants. Prions released by deer bind to soil and vegetation, where they remain infectious for years or even decades. This environmental reservoir drives continued transmission even when host densities are reduced. It also complicates management tools like targeted culling, because removal of infected animals does not eliminate prions already on the landscape.

A third challenge comes from complex host ecology and human-mediated spread. Cervid species differ in susceptibility and prevalence patterns—mule deer and white-tailed deer show high infection rates, while elk show lower but sustainable transmission. Dispersal movements of yearlings, seasonal migrations, and high deer densities amplify disease spread. Meanwhile, movement of captive cervids, transport of carcasses, use of attractants, and baiting practices contribute to long-distance or rapid geographic expansion of the disease (Lecture 17). These human behaviors often conflict with public expectations about hunting, recreation, and deer management.

A fourth challenge is imperfect surveillance. Agencies rely on hunter-harvest submissions and targeted sampling, but detecting CWD at extremely low prevalence (\<1%) requires large sample sizes that are often unsustainable. False assumptions of “absence” can occur if surveillance intensity varies by region or if testing coverage is insufficient. Early detection is critical, yet the tools available make this phase the most difficult to monitor accurately.

Finally, socio-political resistance limits management options. Regulations that restrict baiting, supplemental feeding, or carcass movements are often unpopular with hunters. Population-reduction strategies, such as increased bag limits or post-season culling, can generate public opposition even when biologically necessary. These conflicts reduce agency flexibility and make consistent long-term implementation difficult.

Together, these obstacles—biological, ecological, and social, create a disease system where CWD spreads slowly but relentlessly. As emphasized throughout Lecture 17, the most effective strategy is not eradication but slowing spatial spread and maintaining deer populations through sustained surveillance, regulatory consistency, and clear communication with stakeholders.

**4. You are given data from a closed study population of 60 RFID-tagged armadillos monitored at sampling stations (no capture required).

**5. A beaver carcass was found at the Gunnison River Whitewater Park, Gunnison, Colorado in October 2025. Samples collected during the post-mortem examination were submitted to the Veterinary Diagnostic Lab. The lab reported that the animal was positive for Tularemia.**

**a. Name the etiological agent of this disease. What subspecies of this agent causes Tularemia in aquatic animals like beavers?**

Tularemia is caused by *Francisella tularensis*, a highly infectious, gram-negative intracellular bacterium that circulates widely in wildlife across North America. In semi-aquatic mammals such as beavers and muskrats, disease is most often associated with *F. tularensis subsp. holarctica* (Type B), the form adapted to water-linked transmission cycles. This subspecies is routinely detected in river systems, wetlands, and marshes where carcass contamination can maintain the pathogen in the local environment.

**b. What are the different routes of transmission for this agent?**

The agent moves through several transmission routes that reflect its broad ecological footprint. Exposure can occur through arthropod vectors such as ticks and deer flies, direct handling of infected animals, ingestion of contaminated water, or inhalation of aerosolized bacteria from disturbed vegetation or carcasses. Aquatic systems play an important role because Type B persists in cool water and mud, creating risk for both wildlife and people who work or recreate near these habitats. The Gunnison River case follows this pattern of environmental exposure linked to a susceptible semi-aquatic species.

**c. Describe key features/characteristics of this pathogen in the context of human health/ public health.**

From a public health standpoint, *F. tularensis* is notable for its extremely low infectious dose—fewer than ten organisms can initiate disease—and its ability to survive inside macrophages, allowing systemic spread once infection occurs. The organism is a CDC Tier 1 select agent due to its ease of aerosolization and the severity of pneumonic disease in humans. Although Type B infections are generally less severe than Type A, both forms underscore the need for rapid reporting, proper carcass handling, and awareness of environmental persistence in river systems that support outdoor recreation, trapping, and wildlife management.

**8. Georgia has a white-tailed deer population of \~ 1 million. A total of 1351 samples from hunter-harvested deer were tested for Chronic Wasting Disease in 2022. None of the samples tested positive for CWD. Using the hypergeometric distribution, Georgia DNR determines that CWD is not present above 0.2% prevalence in Georgia’s white tailed deer population. You are asked to comment on Georgia DNR’s CWD surveillance approach. In your commentary, explain the downside of using hypergeometric distribution for making decisions about wildlife disease surveillance.**

Georgia DNR’s conclusion, that no detected positives among 1,351 hunter-harvested deer indicates CWD is not present above 0.2% prevalence, is mathematically correct under the assumptions of the hypergeometric distribution. However, the hypergeometric model assumes perfect detection, perfect sampling, and a truly random sample from the entire population. These assumptions rarely hold in wildlife disease surveillance (Lecture 17).

The primary weakness is that hunter-harvested samples are not a random or spatially uniform representation of the deer population. Hunters do not sample fawns, sick deer, or low-harvest regions evenly, and participation varies by season and location. Because CWD has long asymptomatic periods and highly clustered spatial patterns, the disease can remain undetected even when present, especially at low prevalence. The hypergeometric approach therefore creates a false sense of certainty, because its statistical inference does not account for imperfect detection, biased sampling, or environmental persistence of prions (Lecture 17).

**9. Place the following diseases in appropriate quadrants in the above figure. Explain your choice of quadrants.**

a\. SARS-CoV-2. Case 3 – True multi-host pathogen. High human-to-human transmission; multiple animal hosts; persistent across species. (Lectures 3 and 10).

b\. Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome.  Case 1 – Spillover. Rodent-to-human only; no onward human transmission. (Lectures 3 and 11).

c\. Langya Henipavirus. Case 1 – Spillover. Shrew reservoir; no sustained human transmission. (Lecture 11).

d\. Brucellosis. Case 3 – Persistent multi-host pathogen. Sustained host-to-host transmission and cross-species persistence. (Lecture 14).

e\. West Nile virus. Case 2 – Apparent multi-host pathogen. Birds sustain transmission; humans are dead-end hosts. (Lecture 9).

**10. Anisakiasis is the disease caused by infection with the stomach worm *Anisakis simplex*. It reaches sexual maturity and reproduces in marine mammals. In the following figure, identify the definitive host, a dead-end host, a paratenic host, and an intermediate host. Explain your answers. (Lecture 12)**

Definitive Host: Marine mammals (dolphins). Adult *Anisakis simplex* reach sexual maturity only in marine mammals. The diagram shows L3 to L4 to adults occurring inside marine mammals, followed by defecation of eggs. By definition, the definitive host is where the parasite reaches sexual maturity and reproduces.

Dead-End Host: Humans. Humans become infected by ingesting L3 larvae in raw/undercooked fish. Larvae cannot develop further or complete the life cycle inside humans. Humans do not shed eggs back into the environment. Therefore, humans are biological dead ends for *Anisakis simplex*.

Intermediate Host: Crustaceans. After eggs hatch, free-living larvae (L1–L3) are ingested by small crustaceans. Crustaceans allow larval development to the infective L3 stage, the stage required by the next host. This is the defining role of the first intermediate host.

Paratenic Host: Fish and Cephalopods. Fish and cephalopods acquire L3 larvae by ingesting infected crustaceans. Larvae become encapsulated in the tissues but do not develop further. They serve as transport hosts, passing infective larvae to marine mammals and humans. That “holding but not developing” role defines a paratenic host.

**11. All infected hosts are diseased. Comment using appropriate examples.**

This statement is false. Infection does not always lead to clinical disease, and there are several examples from lectures and graduate presentations. These examples explain that infection represents the presence and replication of a pathogen, whereas disease reflects the physiological damage that may or may not follow. (Lecture 2)

In Koalas, *Chlamydia pecorum* infections can remain subclinical; many individuals carry the pathogen for life but show no outward signs until environmental stress or immune suppression triggers disease.

A similar pattern occurs in prion diseases, cervids infected with CWD can shed infectious prions for 18–24 months before developing neurological symptoms, making them infectious long before they are clinically diseased.

In vector-borne systems, infection and disease are not synonymous: birds infected with West Nile virus often remain asymptomatic reservoirs, maintaining transmission without showing illness.

**12. Klepac et al. estimated an R~0~ of 2.5 for the 2002 Phocine Distemper virus epidemic in Dutch harbor seals. Assuming that an effective PDV vaccine is available, what proportion of the seal population should be vaccinated to prevent a future outbreak of PDV? (lecture 4)**

p = 1 – (1/R~0~); R~0~ = 2.5

p = 1 – (1/2.5) = 1 – 0.4 = 0.6

At least 60% of the seal population must be vaccinated to prevent a future PDV outbreak.

**13. What are some of the main challenges in managing wildlife diseases? Explain using relevant examples.**

Managing wildlife diseases is difficult because detection, control, and long-term monitoring all have limitations in free-ranging systems. Snake Fungal Disease (SFD) illustrates several of these challenges. *Ophidiomyces ophiodiicola* causes a wide range of clinical signs, but many wild snakes remain cryptic or only briefly visible during the active season, resulting in poor case detection. Surveillance relies heavily on opportunistic encounters, and even when snakes are found, lesions can mimic trauma or bacterial infection, making diagnosis uncertain without laboratory confirmation. In addition, different species vary in susceptibility, and environmental factors such as soil type and humidity influence pathogen persistence. These elements make it hard for agencies to estimate true prevalence or design targeted interventions for SFD.

A second challenge is the presence of long incubation periods and asymptomatic shedding, which complicates both surveillance and management. Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) demonstrates this problem clearly. Cervids shed infectious prions for one to two years before displaying symptoms, meaning the disease is spreading long before managers can identify infected individuals. By the time CWD is detected, the disease is often well established, and eradication becomes nearly impossible. This early, undetected spread forces agency to rely on population-level strategies such as harvest manipulation, carcass-movement restrictions, and long-term surveillance rather than direct treatment.

A third major challenge is multi-host dynamics and environmental reservoirs, which prevent simple control strategies. West Nile virus is maintained primarily in bird–mosquito cycles, with spillover into humans, horses, and other wildlife. Because mosquitoes are the primary vectors, wildlife agencies cannot manage the disease directly in reservoir hosts or human populations, and eliminating environmental breeding sites is often impractical at large scales. Similarly, Brucellosis in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem persists due to interactions among elk, bison, and cattle, with each species experiencing different exposure risks and management constraints.

A final challenge is social and logistical barriers, especially when disease management affects hunters, landowners, or the public. Graduate presentations on koala chlamydiosis highlighted the difficulty of implementing vaccination programs that require animal handling, repeated dosing, or habitat access. For wildlife agencies in North America, regulations that restrict carcass movement, baiting, or captive cervid operations—strategies proven to slow CWD spread—often face resistance from stakeholders. Even when science supports intervention public acceptance can determine whether a policy succeeds.
