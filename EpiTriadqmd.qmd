## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

Worksheet 2 Sample size for disease detection

https://github.com/anyadoc/audiseco/commit/ac0296d31285891d4a223cc967712fcc32aa98b9#diff-a4e970b31a85978f04fcf66b97f24c64c6eb74d97c79552f751416b26bb86d2e

1) Find the sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a herd of 5000 deer. The desired level of confidence is 95%. 

Answer: (59) ≈ 60

2) Using the hypergeometric distribution, compare the sample size requirements for the following scenarios:                                                                                      

a) 95% confidence in detecting a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population

Answer: (290) ≈ 300

b) 99% confidence in detecting a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population

Answer: (224) ≈ 230

3) You sample 300 deer from a high fenced facility that has a herd of 4000. None of the 300 deer have antibodies against Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease. Based on this finding, you are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is < 1%.

Worksheet 3: Measures of disease frequency: Prevalence and Incidence

a) Find incidence on day 06/12/25, 06/14/25 and 06/15/25. Write the unit for incidence. (9 points)      

Incidence proportion (risk) for a day = (new cases that day) / (susceptible at start of day). Unit: proportion per day (% per day).

Incidence proportion (risk) for a day ="new cases that day" /"susceptible at start of day" .

Unit: proportion per day (often reported as a % per day).

06/12/25

New cases = 5.

Susceptible at start = 56-5=51(5 had ever been infected by end 06/11).

Incident = 5/51= 0.0980 ≈ 9.8% per day.

06/14/25

New cases = 2.

Susceptible at start = 56-12=44(12 had ever been infected by end 06/13).

Incidence =2/44= 0.04545 ≈ 4.55% per day.

06/15/25

New cases = 0.

Susceptible at start = 56-14=42(14 had ever been infected by end 06/14).

Incidence = 0/42 = 0% per day.

b) What is the prevalence of conjunctivitis on 06/13/25 and 06/16/25? What is the unit for prevalence.   (5 points)                              

Point prevalence = (number of cases on the day) / (total herd size).

Unit: proportion (% of herd).

06/13/25: 12 cases / 56 = 0.2143 ≈ 21.43%

06/16/25: 5 cases / 56 = 0.0893 ≈ 8.93%

c) On which day is the prevalence same as the incidence (except the units)? (3 points)

On 06/10/25, prevalence = 1 case and incidence = 1 new case.

Although units differ, the numeric values were equal.

d) On which day is the incidence lowest?  (3 points)

The lowest incidence occurred on 06/15/25 (and also on 06/16/25), with 0 new cases.
