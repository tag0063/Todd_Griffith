## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

Worksheet 2 Sample size for disease detection

https://github.com/anyadoc/audiseco/commit/ac0296d31285891d4a223cc967712fcc32aa98b9#diff-a4e970b31a85978f04fcf66b97f24c64c6eb74d97c79552f751416b26bb86d2e

1) Find the sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a herd of 5000 deer. The desired level of confidence is 95%. 

Answer: (59) ≈ 60

2) Using the hypergeometric distribution, compare the sample size requirements for the following scenarios:                                                                                      

a) 95% confidence in detecting a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population

Answer: (290) ≈ 300

b) 99% confidence in detecting a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population

Answer: (224) ≈ 230

3) You sample 300 deer from a high fenced facility that has a herd of 4000. None of the 300 deer have antibodies against Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease. Based on this finding, you are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is < 1%.

Worksheet 3: Measures of disease frequency: Prevalence and Incidence

a) Find incidence on day 06/12/25, 06/14/25 and 06/15/25. Write the unit for incidence. (9 points)      

06-12-25: 5 new cases

5/(56-5) = 9.8 % per day

06-13-25: 2 new cases

2/(51-2) = 4.1 % per day

06-14-25: 2 new cases

2/(49-2) = 4.3 % per day

06-15-25: 0 new cases

b) What is the prevalence of conjunctivitis on 06/13/25 and 06/16/25? What is the unit for prevalence.   (5 points)        

06/13/25: 12 cases / 56 = 0.2143 = 21.43%

06/16/25: 5 cases / 56 = 0.0893 = 8.93%

c) On which day is the prevalence same as the incidence (except the units)? (3 points)

On 06/10/25, prevalence = 1 case and incidence = 1 new case.

Although units differ, the numeric values were equal.

d) On which day is the incidence lowest?  (3 points)

The lowest incidence occurred on 06/15/25 (and also on 06/16/25), with 0 new cases.
