**Identifying Ticks and Public Health Significance**

Key external features of hard ticks (family *Ixodidae*) are visible with a hand lens or low-power microscope. These ticks possess a rigid dorsal shield (scutum), which partially covers the back in females and the entire dorsum in males. Their mouthparts (capitulum) project forward from the front of the body, and both nymphs and adults have eight legs but lack antennae. Additional traits include the position of the anal groove, presence of spiracular plates, and visibility of eyes or festoons. These can help distinguish among genera. These structural markers are useful for identifying common North American species, including *Ixodes scapularis* (black-legged tick), Dermacentor variabilis (American dog tick), and *Amblyomma americanum* (lone star tick) (Keirans & Litwak, 1989).

Ticks in the United States can transmit a range of pathogens These include bacteria, viruses, and parasites. These can lead to serious illnesses in humans. Among the most prevalent tickborne diseases are Lyme disease, anaplasmosis, ehrlichiosis, babesiosis, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and Powassan virus disease (CDC, 2024a). Each year, U.S. health departments report more than 46,000 cases of these infections (CDC, 2024b). As tick populations expand, the risk of exposure increases—even in regions where certain species were previously uncommon (CDC, 2024c). To reduce the chance of infection, the CDC advises using EPA-registered insect repellents, wearing protective clothing such as long sleeves and pants, performing thorough tick checks after outdoor activities, and removing any attached ticks promptly and properly (CDC, 2024d).

# **Midterm Corrections**

Dear Dr. Belsare,

Thank you for the opportunity to submit corrections. I reviewed all questions where partial credit was deducted and made appropriate revisions. For your reference, I’ve included my corrected responses to Questions 7 and 9 below.

**Question 7**

In May 2015, a catastrophic die-off of Saiga antelope occurred in central Kazakhstan, resulting in the deaths of more than 200,000 individuals in less than two weeks. This event remains one of the most severe wildlife mortality incidents ever recorded. Understanding the proximate cause, environmental triggers, and ecological mechanisms provides valuable insight into wildlife disease ecology and future conservation planning. (20 points)

**Proximate Cause**

The immediate cause of death was hemorrhagic septicemia, triggered by the normally benign bacterium *Pasteurella multocida* type B. Under ordinary conditions, this bacterium exists harmlessly in the tonsils and upper respiratory tract of Saiga. During the 2015 calving season, unusually warm and humid weather created ideal conditions for bacterial proliferation and virulence activation. Once systemic infection occurred, the bacteria spread rapidly through the bloodstream, causing acute septicemia and internal hemorrhaging. Affected animals died within twenty-four hours, with mortality reaching nearly one hundred percent in impacted herds.

**Mechanism Leading to Large-Scale Mortality**

Several ecological and physiological factors contributed to the rapid, large-scale mortality. Saiga antelope calve synchronously, forming dense aggregations of females and newborns, which increases exposure and stress. The combination of high humidity, elevated temperatures, and dense grouping likely compromised immune function and enhanced bacterial activation. Because Pasteurella multocida is an endemic bacterium, every individual was susceptible, and the outbreak occurred almost simultaneously across multiple herds. The speed and severity of infection left no opportunity for behavioral avoidance, natural immunity, or management intervention to mitigate losses.

**Preventive Measures**

Future prevention efforts should focus on anticipating and managing the environmental conditions that promote bacterial outbreaks. This includes continuous monitoring of temperature, humidity, and herd aggregation during calving seasons. Early disease surveillance programs should collect carcass samples and conduct laboratory diagnostics to confirm bacterial activation. In regions with high historical risk, managers could explore limited prophylactic vaccination or temporary herd dispersal during extreme weather. Prompt carcass disposal through burning or deep burial is essential to prevent contamination of soil and water sources.

**Broader Conservation Strategies**

To safeguard Saiga populations from future epizootics, conservation planning must enhance both ecological and population resilience. Maintaining several subpopulations across their range reduces the risk that a single outbreak will cause species-wide collapse. Protecting migration routes and calving areas reduces crowding and stress, which are major contributors to disease expression. Implementing a One Health approach that integrates wildlife, livestock, and human disease surveillance will allow for coordinated monitoring and response. Long-term monitoring using remote sensing and telemetry can help identify climatic and ecological conditions that signal disease risk. Engaging local herders and communities strengthens reporting networks and minimizes human disturbance during calving periods.

**Summary**

The 2015 Saiga mortality event demonstrated how environmental stress can transform a normally harmless bacterium into a fatal pathogen. This outbreak underscores the interconnectedness of climate, host physiology, and microbial ecology. Comprehensive surveillance, habitat protection, and integrated health management are essential to prevent future catastrophic losses and ensure the persistence of Saiga antelope across the Central Asian plain.

**Question 9**

**Explanation:**

R₀ is the average number of secondary infections from one case in a fully susceptible population.

Each illustration represents one infectious flamingo (red) and the number of susceptible flamingos (blue) it infects. Each arrow represents one secondary infection.

**Illustration Number of Secondary Infections**

1             1

2             3

3             2

4             0

**Calculation**

1\. Secondary infections: 1 + 3 + 2 + 0 = 6

2\. Total infectious individuals (red flamingos): 4

3\. Calculate the average number of new infections per infectious host:

   R₀ = 6 / 4 = 1.5

**Explanation**

The calculated R₀ = 1.5 indicates that each infected flamingo, on average, produces 1.5 new infections in a fully susceptible population.

Because R₀ \> 1, the infection has the potential to spread and become established in the population.

If R₀ were \< 1, the infection would likely fade out over time.

# **Worksheet 4: Multi-host pathogens, Spillover**

**1. MERS-CoV is primarily maintained in human populations. (2 points)**

Incorrect

MERS-CoV is not maintained in human populations. The primary reservoir is the camel. Camels harbor the virus endemically and periodically transmit it to humans through direct contact (handling, milking, slaughter) or respiratory droplets.

2.  **Camels serve as the main animal reservoir for MERS-CoV. (2 points)**

    Correct

Camels are the primary animal reservoir for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The virus has been endemic in camel populations across the Arabian Peninsula, North Africa, and parts of East Africa for decades.

3.  **Humans are dead-end hosts for MERS-CoV. (2 points)**

    Correct (Depending on the context)

    In most situations, humans act as dead-end hosts for MERS-CoV because the virus does not circulate sustainably within human populations. Most human infections result from direct contact with infected camels rather than ongoing person-to-person transmission.

    However, limited human-to-human transmission can occur, particularly in healthcare or household settings, where close contact enables spread through respiratory droplets.  Humans are functionally dead-end hosts under natural conditions, but not strictly so, since transmission is possible in specific high-risk environments.

4.  **The estimated case fatality rate for human MERS-CoV infections is approximately 65%. (2 points)**

    Incorrect

    The case fatality rate (CFR) for human MERS-CoV infections is approximately 35%, not 65%. This is based on confirmed cases reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) since the virus was first identified in 2012.

5.  **The epidemic curve indicates this is a point source outbreak. (2 points)**

    Incorrect

    The MERS-CoV epidemic curve does not represent a point source outbreak. A point source outbreak occurs when all cases are exposed to the same infection source at roughly the same time, producing a sharp, single peak followed by a rapid decline

**Worksheet 5: Community Epidemiology Framework**

**Marburg Virus Outbreak, Rwanda 2024**

The first person to become infected in the current Marburg virus outbreak in Rwanda probably contracted the disease during a visit to a cave with Egyptian rousette bats/fruit bats that are known reservoir of Marburg virus. As of 19 December 2024, 66 cases of Marburg virus infection were documented, and most of the people infected were health care workers, mainly those who worked in intensive care units. ​

​1. Using the community epidemiology framework developed by Fenton and Pedersen, would you classify this Marburg virus outbreak as a spillover event or an emerging infectious disease? Justify your classification.                                                **5 points**

Using the community epidemiology framework developed by Fenton and Pedersen (2005), the 2024 Marburg virus outbreak in Rwanda is best classified as an emerging infectious disease rather than a single spillover event. The first human infection likely occurred after exposure to Egyptian rousette bats (*Rousettus aegyptiacus*), which serve as the natural reservoir for Marburg virus. This initial case represents a classic spillover, direct transmission from the wildlife reservoir (H₁) to a novel host (H₂).

However, the outbreak expanded beyond that initial exposure. Most of the 66 confirmed cases were health-care workers, primarily those in intensive care units, demonstrating sustained human-to-human transmission within the H₂ population. In the Fenton and Pedersen continuum, this pattern supports with Case 3, a “true multi-host pathogen,” characterized by limited between-species transmission (bats to humans) but high within-species transmission among humans. This transition from a zoonotic spillover to localized amplification reflects the ecological progression of an emerging infectious disease.

The Marburg outbreak illustrates how pathogens can cross species barriers and achieve temporary persistence in human populations when ecological and behavioral conditions, such as health-care exposure, permitted transmission. It demonstrates the importance of controlling infection at the human–wildlife interface and within community settings to prevent a spillover from becoming an emerging disease.

2\. What measures could be implemented to reduce the risk of transmission in both community and healthcare settings?                                                              **5 points**

Reducing Marburg virus transmission requires coordinated actions that address both community-level exposure and health-care transmission risks.

At the community level, the primary goal is to prevent initial spillover from wildlife reservoirs. Education campaigns should focus on minimizing direct contact with Egyptian rousette bats and avoiding entry into known roosting caves. Community leaders, hunters, and tourism guides play key roles in risk communication, especially in regions where bat colonies and humans overlap. Safe burial practices and culturally sensitive guidance on handling bodies are essential to reduce secondary transmission from deceased individuals.

In health-care settings, infection prevention and control must be immediate and strict. Health-care workers should use standard, contact, and droplet precautions, including gowns, gloves, N95 masks, and face shields, when caring for suspected or confirmed cases. Training and reinforcement of donning and doffing procedures are critical to prevent accidental exposure. Isolation units should be used to separate confirmed patients, and all medical waste and contaminated materials must be disinfected or incinerated under biosafety protocols.

As emphasized by Nutt (2025), equitable outbreak response depends on protecting both patients and providers. Providing adequate personal protective equipment, fair compensation, and mental health support for front-line health-care workers builds trust and ensures compliance with safety measures. Strengthening community partnerships, ensuring transparent communication, and respecting local customs all enhance public cooperation and long-term disease control.

Together, these interventions limit both zoonotic spillover and human-to-human amplification, reducing the likelihood that localized outbreaks evolve into broader epidemics.

+------------+-------+--------------+--------------------+----------------------+

**Fisher’s exact test:** p = 0.1987

The prevalence of *Vertico* infection was **30.0 %** (95 % CI 14.0–52.5 %) in Pond 1 and **6.7 %** (95 % CI 0.3–30.2 %) in Pond 2.\
Fisher’s exact test yielded **p = 0.1987**, indicating the difference in infection rates between ponds was **not statistically significant** (p \> 0.05).\

Although the point estimate is higher in Pond 1, the wide overlapping confidence intervals suggest the observed variation may reflect sampling error rather than a true ecological difference.
